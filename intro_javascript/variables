### **Basics of JavaScript**

- **Multi-paradigm Language**: JavaScript supports functional, procedural, and object-oriented programming.
- **Data Storage**: Every application needs an area to store its data. Variables help achieve this.
- **Program vs Process**: A program in its running state is called a process.

### **Keywords in JavaScript**

Keywords are reserved words in programming languages used for specific purposes. You **cannot reassign or change their meaning**.

Examples in JavaScript:

- `let`, `const`, `return`, `if`, `else`

> **Interactive Tip**: Try using `let` or `const` in your browser console.  
> Example: `let x = 10; console.log(x);`

### **What Are Variables?**

- Variables are **memory containers** that store data and have a unique name.
- They allow developers to reuse and manipulate stored data during a program's execution.

**In Simple Terms**:

> A variable is like a bucket with a label (its name) that holds something inside (its value).
