// ### **Ways to Create Variables**
var firstName = "Simond";
let lastName = "Richard";
const age = 33


//Using String Concatenation
console.log("Betty CEO name is " + firstName + " " + lastName + " and his age is " + age);

//Using Template Literals (Backticks)
console.log(`Betty CEO name is ${firstName} ${lastName} and his age is ${age}`);

console.log(firstName , age , lastName )
